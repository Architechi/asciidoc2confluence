# asciidoc2confluence

a groovy script to export an HTML file generated by asciidoc to several confluence pages

The easiest way to get this up and running is to modify the Config.groovy to fit your environment and load the main script into the groovyConsole. You then need some HTML output from asciidoctor -> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arc42/arc42.github.io/master/template/en/arc42-template.html might be a good start.

When you start the script the first time, it will try to divide the html file into subsections and push them to your confluence instance.
